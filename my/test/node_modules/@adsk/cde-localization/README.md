Description
===========

This package contains helpers for localization the Common Data Experience. It contains the string table that gets localized via the continuous localization process as well as functions to help formatting dates and times. By having this as a separate package, it will allow us to share strings across the multiple packages that may require them (Navigation, Properties, ...).

To read a string from the localization table, refernce the Localize pacakge:
```
import { Localize } from '@adsk/cde-localization';
```

Then use the `getBundle` method to get the current bundle and read the string from that bundle:
```
    const bundle = Localize.getBundle();
    const openString = bundle.text.open;
```

The string tables can be found in the `bundles` folder.

To add a new string to be localized, simply update the `localizationBundle.json` file, which contains the english strings. As part fo the continuous localization process, we will recieve PRs from the localization team that updates the rest of the files as they are localized.
